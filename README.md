Tournament Code
===============

A simple League of Legends tournament code generator.

* First download or clone this repo :)
* Then run `npm install` to install dev dependencies. Use sudo if needed.

You'll need to have Gulp installed. If you already have Gulp installed, you can skip the following line. It is as simple as running:
* `npm install -g gulp`

During development mode, run the default task so you'll have watchers and browser sync. Simply do the following:
* Run `gulp` to start it up
* Try to modify html, scss and javascript files and see how the page gets updated with BrowserSync

When you're ready to deploy, simply do the following:
* Run `gulp deploy`
* All of the files you need will be in /dist with your images optimized, css compressed and js compressed
